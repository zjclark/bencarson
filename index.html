            <h3>My Thoughts</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 30px; padding: 10px;">The book I chose to read was "Gifted Hands", which is an autobiography of Ben Carson. I thought it was very interesting and there's a lot you can learn from his life. At times in the book I got disinterested because somethings in the book I found hard to read and wordy. The biggest take away I got from the book was that you can do great things with your life no matter your situation. Ben Carson dealt with many struggles as a child including poverty and family issues. Through this, however, he never gave up on hus dream to become a doctor, and eventually one day, he did. I thought that was really inspiring. Overall I thought it was a pretty good book if you like biographies, and there's a lot you can learn from it.</p>
